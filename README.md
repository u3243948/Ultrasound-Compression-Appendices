Ultrasound imaging is a cornerstone diagnostic tool in healthcare, renowned for its noninvasive, real-time capabilities, portability, and cost-effectiveness. Its role in telemedicine, 
particularly in remote and resource-limited settings reliant on constrained network 
infrastructures like 3G, underscores the necessity for efficient image data transmission. 
However, ultrasound's high data volume and unique imaging characteristics—including 
speckle noise, spatial resolution, and contrast resolution—pose substantial transmission 
challenges in low-bandwidth environments.

This thesis systematically addresses these challenges by conducting a comprehensive 
comparative analysis of existing and novel compression techniques specifically optimized for 
ultrasound data transmission in telemedicine. Leveraging specialized datasets, namely Breast 
Ultrasound Images (BUI) and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) images, this research 
evaluates traditional methods such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet 
Transform (DWT), Hybrid DCT-DWT, and more advanced unexplored methods including 
Modified Singular Value Decomposition (MSVD), Modified Fast Fractal Image Compression 
(MFFI), and 3D Discrete Cosine Transform (3D DCT).

Evaluation metrics employed include Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) for spatial 
resolution, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for speckle noise preservation, Contrast-toNoise Ratio (CNR) for contrast resolution, Compression Ratio (CR) for efficiency 
assessment, and transmission times under simulated 3G and 4G network conditions. The 
findings demonstrate that advanced methods such as MSVD and Prediction-Based 
Compression effectively balance high compression efficiency with robust diagnostic integrity, 
significantly outperforming traditional techniques in preserving crucial diagnostic details.

This research highlights the importance of compression optimization in enhancing teleultrasound capabilities, particularly in rural healthcare delivery. It contributes to the field by 
identifying and recommending methods that best maintain diagnostic quality while ensuring 
efficient transmission, thus improving clinical outcomes and healthcare accessibility in 
bandwidth-limited telemedicine environments. The thesis provides a solid foundation for 
future research, offering practical guidance for medical professionals and policymakers 
aiming to implement scalable, high-quality telemedicine solutions.
